## 1. Summary

In this project, we aimed to build a regression model using the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) algorithm to predict the age of an abalone using its physical characteristics and sex. Since determining abalone age traditionally requires cutting the shell and counting rings (a destructive and time-consuming process), machine learning methods offer a non-destructive alternative for estimating age from easily measurable features. Age in this dataset is represented as Rings + 1.5, where each ring corresponds roughly to one year of growth and the additional 1.5 accounts for early development. For example, an abalone with 10 rings would be approximately 11.5 years old.

Our k-NN Regressor (with k=5) produced an RMSE of approximately 2.2 rings on the test set, meaning the model’s predictions deviate from the true age by about 2 rings on average. The scatter plot of actual versus predicted values shows a generally increasing trend but with noticeable spread, especially among older abalones. This indicates that while k-NN captures broad growth patterns, predicting exact age remains challenging due to natural biological variability and overlapping physical features. Nevertheless, the model produces reasonable baseline performance and demonstrates that physical measurements contain meaningful information about abalone age. Further improvement could be achieved by tuning k or exploring more complex models.

Understanding the age of an abalone is important for marine biology research, sustainable fisheries management, and conservation, but the traditional method of aging, cutting the shell and counting internal rings, is destructive and difficult to apply at scale. A predictive model offers an alternative, which is useful for studying wild populations without harming them. However, its accuracy is limited by natural biological variability and nonlinear growth patterns, especially in older abalones. This means that while machine learning can support broad age estimation and population assessments, it may still fall short in situations where precise age measurements are required.

## 2. Introduction

#### 2.1 Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to investigate whether physical features and sex can accurately predict the age of an abalone.

#### 2.2 Background:
Abalones are marine molluscs that are widely harvested for food and shell products. Understanding their age structure is crucial for fisheries management and conservation planning [@nash1994]. However, determining age is not straightforward: the most accurate method requires cutting the shell and counting internal rings under a microscope, which is destructive, labour-intensive, and not feasible at scale for monitoring wild populations.

The Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@dua1995] provides measurements of physical characteristics including:

- Categorical: sex (M, F, I)

- Continuous: length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight

The dataset contains 4177 observations and 8 predictor variables, providing a reasonably large sample for training and evaluating regression models. Age is recorded via the Rings variable, with age in years calculated as Rings + 1.5. Because Rings is numeric, predicting age is naturally formulated as a regression problem. Using these non-destructive measurements to estimate age could support more sustainable management and research.

## 3. Methods

#### 3.1 Data and preprocessing

Data were downloaded from the UCI repository [@dua1995] and validated using a pandera schema to check column types, allowed categories for Sex, value ranges, missingness, and duplicate rows. Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed using the validated dataset. This helped to understand the relationships between physical measurements and age and check for nonlinear patterns and outliers.

Before fitting the model, we performed several preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and suitability for machine learning. We first applied one-hot encoding to the Sex variable to convert it into numeric indicator features. Next, we split the dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% test set to allow for an unbiased evaluation of model performance. Finally, we used deepchecks to examine potential data issues, including feature–label correlations, feature–feature correlations, and label drift between the training and test sets. These checks helped confirm that our features were appropriate for modeling and that no major distribution shifts existed between the training and evaluation data. Highly correlated weight-related features were expected due to shared biological growth processes, and the checks confirmed that there were no severe issues beyond this expected multicollinearity.

#### 3.2 Model Selection

We used a k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) regressor to predict abalone age from physical measurements and sex. For any new abalone, the model identifies the k most similar individuals in the standardized feature space, based on Euclidean distance, and predicts age by averaging the number of rings among those neighbours. We selected k-NN because it is a non-parametric and flexible method that makes no strong assumptions about linearity, offers intuitive predictions grounded in similarity to known examples, and is well suited to capturing the nonlinear relationships between size, weight, sex, and age observed in abalone growth patterns [@waugh1995].

#### 3.3 Model Evaluation

Model performance is assessed, which loads the saved k-NN model and scaler, applies them to the training and test sets, and computes the RMSE for both splits. The script also generates an actual-versus-predicted plot for the test set (Figure @fig-knn-actual-pred). RMSE is an appropriate evaluation metric because the target variable, Rings, is continuous, and the metric penalizes larger errors more severely, making it well suited for age-estimation tasks where extreme mispredictions are particularly undesirabl

## 4. Results

#### 4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis
Figure 1 summarizes how each physical measurement relates to the number of rings, which serves as a proxy for abalone age. In general, positive associations are observed across most predictors, indicating that larger and heavier abalones tend to have more rings. The observed patterns are nonlinear, with growth appearing faster in younger abalones and gradually slowing for older ones. This widening spread suggests that abalones with similar sizes can still vary considerably in age. Weight-based variables show particularly strong correlations with age, while height appears to be the least informative due to its very narrow range.

Across all measurements, the three sex categories overlap substantially, indicating that sex alone does not form clear separations in age patterns. Because of this, sex is unlikely to serve as a strong individual predictor at this stage, although it is still included as a categorical feature for completeness.

#### 4.2 Model Performance
To evaluate whether physical characteristics can predict age, we trained a k-Nearest Neighbours regression model (k = 5) using scaled predictors. Figure 2 shows the relationship between actual and predicted ring counts on the test set. The dashed line represents perfect prediction. While the model captures the general increasing trend, there is considerable spread, especially for older abalones. This indicates that predictions become less reliable as age increases, which is consistent with the biological variability seen in the EDA.

Model accuracy is summarized using RMSE, with a train RMSE of 1.86 and a test RMSE of 2.29. Given that the age in years is calculated as Rings + 1.5, an RMSE of around 2.3 rings implies that the model typically have an inaccuracy by about two years. This level of accuracy is reasonable for a simple, non-parametric model and suggests that physical features provide useful but imperfect information about age.

## 5. Discussion

The EDA supports the idea that abalone age is broadly reflected in its size and weight, though with substantial natural variability. The nonlinear shape in the plots suggests that growth is not constant across life stages, which aligns with biological expectations. This makes it harder for simple linear relationships to fully capture the underlying patterns.

The kNN model achieved a test RMSE of about 2.29 rings, meaning it usually predicts age within two rings or roughly two years of the true value. For younger abalones, predictions appear more accurate, while error increases for older individuals. This is consistent with the widening spread in the EDA and reflects how size becomes a weaker indicator of age later in life. Overall, the model shows that non-destructive measurements can give a fairly good approximation of age, although they cannot replace more precise biological methods.

From a fisheries or conservation perspective, a model like this is valuable because it allows age estimation without harming the animal. Being able to reasonably estimate age from external measurements supports sustainable management, population monitoring, and ecological research. However, the two-year prediction error may be too large for applications requiring fine distinctions between similar-aged cohorts. 

In terms of assumptions and limitations, first, the model assumes that the relationships observed in the dataset generalize to real-world populations. In practice, growth can vary significantly across habitats, seasons, and food availability, which may reduce the model's accuracy outside the UCI dataset. We also assume that measurement error is small, but in reality, weight and size measurements may be less precise, potentially increasing prediction error.

Another limitation concerns the predictors themselves. Many of the weight-based features are highly correlated, and while kNN can handle this structure, it also means that small measurement differences may disproportionately influence distance calculations. Additionally, height has limited variation and contributes minimally to prediction. Sex was included through onehot encoding, but since all three groups overlap heavily, it does not meaningfully improve the model at this stage.

Finally, kNN does not extrapolate beyond observed examples, which makes it less reliable for rare or extreme cases. Its performance also depends heavily on the choice of k and the density of nearby data points, which may not always reflect the underlying biological complexity of abalone growth [3][4].
