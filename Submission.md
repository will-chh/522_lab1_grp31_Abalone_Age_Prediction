3. Teamwork Contract:

#### Group: 31

#### Work Distributions
We will distribute work fairly by taking into account each member’s strengths, interests, and availability. Major tasks will be discussed collectively before assigning, and we will adjust responsibilities if workload becomes unbalanced. Although each person will take ownership of their assigned tasks, everyone is responsible for reviewing and providing feedback on the team’s work to maintain consistency and quality.

#### Working Hours and Availability
Each team member will contribute consistently throughout the project and communicate clearly about their availability. Members will inform the group in advance if they are unavailable due to personal obligations, such as weekends, or exams. If someone anticipates difficulty completing their assigned tasks on time, they will notify the team as early as possible so that we can adjust plans if needed.

#### Meetings
The team will meet at least twice per week, either online or in person, at times that accommodate everyone’s schedules. Meetings will begin promptly and remain focused on the agenda. We will rotate the responsibility of preparing meeting agendas and documenting minutes. Agendas will be shared ahead of time, and minutes will summarize key decisions, responsibilities, and next steps so that everyone is aligned. The proposed meeting time is: Every Tuesday @12:00pm.

#### Communication
Slack will be our primary communication platform.
    All messages should be acknowledged within 24 hours.
    Members will share updates, blockers, and questions early so the team can support each other.
    Concerns or disagreements should be raised respectfully and openly.
    Critical decisions will be communicated in writing to avoid misalignment.

#### Working Style
We aim to complete assigned tasks several hours before each meeting to give teammates adequate time to review the work. During meetings, we will hold short stand-up style check-ins where each person shares what they have completed, what they are currently working on, and any challenges they are facing. We will also follow consistent coding, documentation, and file naming standards to keep our work organized and easy to follow.

#### Expected Working Quality
Every team member is responsible for producing high-quality, well-documented work. Drafts should be complete before sharing them with the group, and all work should be reviewed before being submitted. We expect each other to take initiative, ask for help when needed, and support others who are learning new tools or concepts. 

#### Conflict Resolution
If a conflict arises, the members involved will first talk privately to resolve the issue respectfully. If the issue remains unresolved, the team will discuss it together with the goal of understanding each perspective and agreeing on a solution. Discussions will focus on behaviors and project-related issues, not personal judgments. If the problem persists, we may involve the TA or instructor. We agree to address conflicts early before they escalate.

#### Accountability
Team members are expected to follow through on commitments. If someone repeatedly misses deadlines, meetings, or communication expectations, the team will discuss the issue openly to understand the cause and find a solution. Continued lack of engagement may require involving the instructor. The team is committed to supporting each other while ensuring that responsibilities are met.
